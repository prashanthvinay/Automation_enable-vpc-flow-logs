VPC Flow Logs enable you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

By default, VPC Flow Logs are not enabled. However, in our scenario, let's say you have a compliance policy that requires they be enabled for any new VPC that gets created in your account.

In this repository, you can find all the resources to automate the creation of VPC Flow Logs whenever a new VPC is created.
